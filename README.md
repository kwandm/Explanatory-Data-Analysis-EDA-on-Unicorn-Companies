# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Unicorn-Companies

Project Description:

The goal of this project was to perform a basic exploratory data analysis of a dataset containing information about Unicorn Companies. Unicorn Companies are private companies with valuations over $1 billion. The dataset provided information about each company's valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and other details. The aim was to extract insights from the data and provide data-driven recommendations for Unicorn Companies in creating good business models and making decisions that focus on high-growth potential.

Steps Taken:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was inspected for any missing or inconsistent data, and necessary data cleaning steps were performed to ensure the data was in a usable format.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Various exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to understand the dataset better. This included analyzing valuation and funding trends, identifying industries with promising growth, assessing leadership team expertise, evaluating geographic diversity, focusing on market potential, considering technology and innovation, and conducting due diligence and risk assessment.

Data Visualization: Visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, violin plots, and histograms were created to present the findings in a clear and understandable manner. These visualizations helped in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

Data-Driven Recommendations: Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, four data-driven recommendations were formulated to assist Unicorn Companies in creating good business models and making informed decisions. These recommendations emphasized focusing on countries with the most unicorns, identifying industries with promising growth, considering top investors, and analyzing the relationship between funding and valuation.

Challenges Faced:

Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the dataset was a challenge. Dealing with missing or inconsistent data required careful handling and decision-making.

Data Interpretation: Extracting meaningful insights from the data and translating them into actionable recommendations required careful analysis and interpretation. It involved understanding the context of the unicorn companies and their unique characteristics.

Visual Presentation: Presenting the findings in a visually appealing and easily understandable format was another challenge. Selecting the most appropriate types of visualizations and effectively communicating the insights required careful consideration.

Overall, this project involved exploring the dataset, conducting data analysis, and providing data-driven recommendations to Unicorn Companies. It required addressing data quality issues, interpreting the data, and presenting the findings in a clear and concise manner.
